# Nand2Tetris Projects

This repository contains my solutions for the 12 projects of the Nand2Tetris course, as outlined on their [official website](http://nand2tetris.org/). Nand2Tetris is a comprehensive course that teaches applied computer science by building a modern computer system from first principles.

## Project Summaries

### Project 1: Boolean Logic
- Building basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) using Nand gates, the fundamental building block of digital electronics.

### Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic
- Implementation of arithmetic operations like addition and ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) using the logic gates developed in Project 1.

### Project 3: Sequential Logic
- Using sequential chips like DFF (Data Flip-Flop), to create memory units such as registers and RAM.

### Project 4: Machine Language
- Introduction to machine language and writing programs directly in binary code that the hardware can execute.

### Project 5: Computer Architecture
- Building a computer system that can run programs written in machine language, including CPU, memory, and instruction handling.

### Project 6: Assembler
- Developing an Assembler to translate assembly language programs into binary machine code.

### Project 7: VM I: Stack Arithmetic
- Implementing stack arithmetic operations and memory access commands in a virtual machine.

### Project 8: VM II: Program Control
- Extending the virtual machine to handle program flow and function calling conventions.

### Project 9: High-Level Language
- Introduction to high-level programming languages through the process of abstraction over machine language, exemplified by building a 16-bit game inspired by the original Legend of Zelda.

### Project 10: Compiler I: Syntax Analysis
- Building a syntax analyzer (parser) as part of a compiler for a high-level language.

### Project 11: Compiler II: Code Generation
- Extending the compiler to generate executable code from the parsed high-level language constructs.

### Project 12: Operating System
- Developing an elementary standard library for an operating system with essential services like system bootstrapping, math operations, string handling, array support, input/output, and memory.

## Usage

Each project directory contains the relevant files for building and testing the components. You will also need the [Nand2Tetris tool suite](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software).
